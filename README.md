# üöÄ Aethon: Your Open-Source Workflow Automation Platform üöÄ

Welcome to **Aethon**! This project is building a powerful, open-source workflow automation tool that allows you to connect different apps and services, automate processes, and visualize your data flows in real-time.

## ‚ú® The Aethon Vision: Visual Automation for Everyone

Imagine a world where you can visually create complex workflows without writing a single line of code. Where you can see your data flowing from one step to the next, and instantly know when something goes right or wrong. That's the vision for Aethon.

We are building a platform that empowers developers and creators to build powerful automations with a simple, intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

-   **Visual & Intuitive:** A clean, node-based canvas for designing, managing, and visualizing your workflows.
-   **Real-time Feedback:** See the status of each node in your workflow as it executes. No more guessing games.
-   **Extensible:** The platform is designed to be easily extended. You can create your own nodes and integrations to fit your custom needs. The only limit is your imagination.
-   **Full SaaS Platform:** Aethon is not just a tool, it's a full-fledged SaaS platform with payments, subscriptions, and user management built-in.

## üó∫Ô∏è Architectural Blueprint: How It All Connects

Aethon is built on a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack to deliver a seamless and real-time user experience.

-   **Framework:** The entire application is built with **Next.js**, providing a powerful React framework for both the frontend and backend.
-   **Real-time Engine:** We use a powerful job execution engine powered by **Ingest** for background job processing, retries, and pub/sub messaging. This, combined with **WebSockets**, provides the real-time visual feedback on the workflow canvas.
-   **Database:** We use **Prisma** as our ORM for type-safe database access, connected to a serverless **Neon** Postgres database.
-   **Authentication:** User authentication and management are handled by **Better Auth**, a modern and flexible authentication solution for Next.js.
-   **Payments & Subscriptions:** The SaaS layer is powered by **Polar**, handling payments and subscriptions seamlessly.
-   **Monitoring & Error Tracking:** We use **Sentry** for comprehensive error tracking, logging, session replays, and even monitoring the performance and token usage of our AI integrations.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Join the Aethon Journey!

Ready to dive in and start building your own automations? Follow the steps in the [Local Development](#-local-development) section to get Aethon running on your machine.

## üè° Local Development

Follow these steps to get Aethon up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/aethon.git
    cd aethon
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, fill in the necessary variables in the `.env` file. See the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section for more details.

4.  **Set up the database:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    npx prisma db push
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîë Environment Variables

You will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a starting point.

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="your_neon_database_url"

# Authentication (Better Auth)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your_better_auth_secret"

CLAUDE_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"

# Google (for Google Form triggers, etc.)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"

# Stripe (for Stripe event triggers)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your_stripe_secret_key"
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_stripe_webhook_secret"

# Webhooks for Messaging
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="your_discord_webhook_url"
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="your_slack_webhook_url"
```
